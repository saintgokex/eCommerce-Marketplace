## Data Exploration



## Limitation 
* Customer data: there’s insufficient data available to track some key performance indicators like customer success, customer buying behaviours  churn rate analysis.
* Correlation ≠ Causation: While a strong correlation exists between number of orders and quantity sold, it doesn't necessarily imply causation. Other factors could influence both order volume and sales volume.
* Regional analysis: there’s unavailability of location data which is important to track buying patterns and behaviors of each region.
* Date table: the unavailability of the date column made it an impossible task to analyze sales performance to understand how seasons/periods affect sales.

## Recommendation
* Leverage the potential of the most sold products to drive revenue: A correlation coefficient of 0.79 signifies strong relationship between number of others and number of units sold. Therefore, the higher the on-demand products are manufactured, the higher the gross merchandise value and the higher RxAll makes on commission.
* Cross-Category Promotions:
  * Design cross-promotional campaigns that bundle low-order-volume products with high-performing items.
  * Offer discounts or incentives for purchasing across different categories.
  * Recommend relevant complementary products within individual product listings.
These will help boost sales of low-performing products

* Further Analysis: Further analysis should be conducted to understand customer preferences and regional variations in product demand. This will aid marketing and promotional strategies.
